Congratulations for passing the combat exam!#speaker:??? #portrait:dinotrainer_neutral #layout:right
I'm sure that other dino told you about me.
Welcome to the training room.#speaker:Turtino #portrait:dinotrainer_neutral #layout:right
It's shaped like a <b><color=\#93c47d>turtle</color></b> to represent the head of the academy.
Each boss you've fought in the dungeon is in each end of the turtle.
When you first entered you should be at the "head" of the turtle.
I would suggest taking out the other bosses in the training room before challenging me at the tail of the turtle.
The "dungeon stats" that I mentioned earlier is permanent and is quite convenient to show progress.
The higher the stats, the better the training is going to be.
